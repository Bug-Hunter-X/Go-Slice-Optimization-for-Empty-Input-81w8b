# Go Slice Optimization for Empty Input

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle performance issue in Go when dealing with slices and empty inputs.  The original code allocates memory even when the input slice is empty. The solution shows an improved approach to prevent this unnecessary allocation, thereby improving performance in situations where the function may be called with empty slices frequently.

## Original Code (bug.go)
The `bug.go` file contains the original implementation with the performance issue.

## Solution (bugSolution.go)
The `bugSolution.go` file provides an optimized version that handles empty slices more efficiently.

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository
2. Navigate to the directory
3. Run `go run bug.go` and `go run bugSolution.go` to see the output and compare their performance (especially with repeated calls using an empty slice).
